###  Structured with NX

Nx is the preeminent toolkit for Monorepo development, which helps  you to build software smarter and faster. With Nx you can build  full-stack applications with your preferred framework, integrate with  modern tools youâ€™re probably already using, and reinforce best practices for your entire development team or enterprise. Use Nx to build  software at scale, the better way.

- Out of the box integration with Cypress, Jest, Typescript, Prettier + more
